"""Resume parsing logic for the Python Resume Parser service.

This module is intentionally framework-agnostic: it knows nothing about FastAPI
and can be imported and unit-tested on its own. The public entry point is
:func:`parse_resume`, which takes raw PDF bytes and returns a structured
``dict`` matching the ``ParsedResume`` schema in ``models.py``.

Design notes
------------
* **PDF text extraction** is done with PyMuPDF (``fitz``).
* **Contact details** (email / phone) use plain regular expressions, which are
  far more reliable than NLP for these well-structured patterns.
* **Name detection** uses spaCy's ``PERSON`` named-entity recognition combined
  with positional and lexical heuristics that explicitly reject cities,
  universities, employers and job titles (so "Surat" or "Example University"
  never win over the real candidate name).
* **Sections** (skills / education / experience / projects) are detected by
  scanning for common heading keywords (with synonym + prefix matching) and
  slicing the text between headings. Non-extracted headings still act as
  boundaries so one section's text never bleeds into another.
* **Entries** inside education / experience / projects are *grouped*: a single
  real-world entry that spans several physical lines (e.g. degree + GPA, or a
  job title followed by bullet points) is merged into one list item instead of
  being split into many.

No external LLM APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, etc.) are used anywhere.
