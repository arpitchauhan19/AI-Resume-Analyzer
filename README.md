**AI Resume Analyzer** is a production-style, microservice full-stack application that turns a raw resume PDF into actionable, recruiter-grade insights. A Python (FastAPI) microservice extracts structured data **on-device**, an Express backend orchestrates uploads and runs a purpose-built **ATS scoring engine**, and a modern React dashboard visualizes the results — score, skill match, completeness, matched/missing keywords, and concrete suggestions.

Built to demonstrate clean service boundaries, REST API design, deterministic NLP parsing, and real deployment — without depending on any paid LLM API.

## 💡 Why This Project?

This project was built as a portfolio-grade full-stack application to demonstrate real-world engineering skills beyond a tutorial CRUD app:

- **Full Stack Development** — end-to-end ownership from UI to API to parser to scoring engine.
- **React + Express + FastAPI integration** — a polyglot stack with three services communicating over HTTP.
- **REST API Design** — clean, predictable endpoints for upload, parsing, health checks, and ATS analysis.
- **Resume Parsing** — deterministic PDF extraction using PyMuPDF, spaCy, and regex (no LLM dependency).
- **ATS Algorithm Design** — keyword normalization, synonym matching, skill match, completeness scoring, and actionable suggestions.
- **Microservice Architecture** — independently deployable frontend, backend, and parser services with clear boundaries.
- **Production Deployment** — live deployment on Render with environment-driven configuration and fail-fast validation.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system is split into three independently runnable services and flows in one direction from a raw PDF to an actionable dashboard:

```
              Resume PDF
                  │
                  ▼
           React Frontend            (Vite SPA · upload + dashboard)
                  │  POST /api/upload
                  ▼
           Express Backend           (REST API · orchestration)
                  │  forward file → POST /parse
                  ▼
        FastAPI Resume Parser        (PyMuPDF + spaCy + regex)
                  │
                  ▼
       Structured Resume JSON        (contact, skills, education, ...)
                  │  POST /api/ats/analyze
                  ▼
             ATS Engine              (keyword match · skill match · scoring)
                  │
                  ▼
              Dashboard              (score, matched/missing keywords, tips)
```

> [!TIP]
> Upload metadata is persisted to **MongoDB** on a best-effort basis. If the database is unavailable, parsing and ATS analysis still work — persistence is simply skipped.

**Request flow:**

1. The user uploads a resume PDF in the React app → `POST /api/upload`.
2. Express stores upload metadata (if MongoDB is available) and forwards the file to the Python parser's `POST /parse`.
3. The parser returns structured resume JSON, which Express relays back to the frontend dashboard.
4. On the dashboard, the user pastes a **job description** → `POST /api/ats/analyze`.
5. The Express **ATS engine** scores the parsed resume against the job description and returns the score, matched/missing keywords, completeness, and suggestions.

> The ATS engine (`backend/src/services/atsService.js`) is pure, dependency-free, and modular — keyword extraction, normalization, matching, skill match, completeness, scoring, and suggestions are each isolated, testable functions.

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **Python** 3.9+
- **MongoDB** (optional — the backend runs without it; upload metadata persistence is skipped if unavailable)

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arpitchauhan19/AI-Resume-Analyzer.git
cd AI-Resume-Analyzer
```

You'll run **three** services. Open three terminals (one per service).

### 1. Python Parser

```bash
cd python-service

# Create & activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# Windows (PowerShell)
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# macOS / Linux
# source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

# One-time: download the spaCy English model
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# Run on http://localhost:8000
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 2. Express Backend

```bash
cd backend

npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env   # Windows: copy .env.example .env

# Run on http://localhost:5000
npm run dev
```

### 3. React Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

npm install

# Configure environment (optional in dev; required for production builds)
cp .env.example .env   # Windows: copy .env.example .env

# Run the Vite dev server on http://localhost:5173
npm run dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Backend (`backend/.env` — see `backend/.env.example`):

| Variable             | Default (development only)                       | Description                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`               | `5000`                                           | Port the Express server listens on            |
| `NODE_ENV`           | `development`                                    | `development` \| `production`                 |
| `MONGODB_URI`        | `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/ai-resume-analyzer`   | MongoDB connection string (optional/best-effort) |
| `CORS_ORIGIN`        | `http://localhost:5173`                          | Comma-separated allowed origins — **required in production** |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE`    | `5242880` (5 MB)                                 | Max upload size in bytes                       |

| `PARSER_SERVICE_URL` | `http://localhost:8000`                          | Base URL of the Python parser service — **required in production** |
| `PARSER_TIMEOUT_MS`  | `30000`                                          | Timeout for parser requests (ms); positive number |

Frontend (`frontend/.env` — see `frontend/.env.example`):

| Variable        | Default (development only) | Description                                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VITE_API_URL`  | `http://localhost:5000`    | Base URL of the Express API — **required for production builds** |

### Production deployment

The localhost defaults above exist purely for local development. They are
**not** used when the services run in production:

- **Backend** — when `NODE_ENV=production`, the server validates its config on
  startup and **refuses to boot** with a clear error unless `PARSER_SERVICE_URL`
  and `CORS_ORIGIN` are set explicitly. This stops a deployed backend from
  silently calling `localhost` services that don't exist.
- **Frontend** — Vite inlines `VITE_API_URL` at **build time**, so it must be
  provided before `npm run build` (e.g. `VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com npm run build`).
  A production build with `VITE_API_URL` unset fails loudly at runtime instead
  of shipping a bundle hard-coded to `http://localhost:5000`.

---

## ☁️ Deployment

All three services are deployed on **Render** as separate, independently scalable units:

| Service | Render Type | Live URL |
| ------- | ----------- | -------- |
| 🖥️ **Frontend** | Static Site | [ai-resume-frontend-fv7v.onrender.com](https://ai-resume-frontend-fv7v.onrender.com) |
| ⚙️ **Backend** | Web Service | [ai-resume-backend-m3tv.onrender.com](https://ai-resume-backend-m3tv.onrender.com) |
| 🧠 **Parser** | Web Service | [ai-resume-parser-fhdr.onrender.com](https://ai-resume-parser-fhdr.onrender.com) |

**How they connect in production:**

- The **frontend** is built with `VITE_API_URL` pointing at the deployed backend URL.
- The **backend** is configured with `PARSER_SERVICE_URL` pointing at the deployed parser URL and `CORS_ORIGIN` set to the frontend URL.
- The **parser** runs as a standalone FastAPI service and is called by the backend over HTTP.

> [!NOTE]
> The backend and parser run on Render's **free tier**, which spins down after inactivity. The first request after idle may take **30–60 seconds** to wake up (cold start). The frontend static site is always available; only the API and parser services are affected.

> [!TIP]
> For local development, all three services run on `localhost` with the defaults documented in [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables). No code changes are needed — only environment configuration differs between dev and production.

---

## 🧗 Challenges Faced

Building a multi-service resume analyzer surfaced several real engineering challenges:

- **Designing communication between three independent services** — coordinating the React frontend, Express backend, and FastAPI parser with clear HTTP contracts and error handling.
- **Handling PDF parsing reliably** — extracting structured data from varied resume formats using PyMuPDF, spaCy NER, and regex heuristics without an LLM.
- **ATS keyword normalization and synonym matching** — canonicalizing skill variants (`React.js` → `react`, `REST APIs` → `restapi`), filtering generic filler words, and preventing false positives (`Java` ≠ `JavaScript`).
- **Environment variable management** — ensuring production never silently falls back to `localhost`, with fail-fast validation on startup.
- **Production deployment on Render** — wiring three separate services with correct CORS, build-time frontend config, and runtime backend-to-parser URLs.
- **Cold-start handling for free-tier services** — accounting for Render's spin-down behavior where backend and parser may take 30–60 seconds to respond after idle.
- **Backend and parser integration** — forwarding multipart file uploads from Express to FastAPI with timeouts, error propagation, and consistent JSON schemas.

---

## 📚 Key Learnings

Through building and deploying this project end-to-end, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **Building scalable REST APIs** — health checks, upload endpoints, and structured JSON responses with proper error handling.
- **React frontend architecture** — page routing, API integration with Axios, loading states, and a component-based dashboard UI.
- **Express backend design** — middleware pipelines, Multer file uploads, service layers, and controller separation.
- **FastAPI microservices** — async Python APIs, Pydantic validation, and PDF parsing as a dedicated service.
- **File upload pipelines** — multipart form handling from browser → Express → FastAPI parser.
- **Production deployments** — deploying a polyglot stack on Render with environment-specific configuration.
- **Environment configuration** — build-time vs. runtime variables, CORS, and production validation.
- **ATS scoring systems** — keyword extraction, synonym normalization, skill matching, completeness checks, and weighted scoring.

---

## 🛣️ Future Improvements

- **OCR support** for scanned / image-only PDFs (e.g. Tesseract).
- **DOCX parsing** in addition to PDF.
- **Semantic matching** using embeddings so synonyms and related skills count toward the score (not just exact keywords).
- **Multi-resume comparison** and history powered by the existing MongoDB layer.
- **Authentication & user accounts** to save analyses over time.
- **Exportable reports** (PDF/JSON) of the ATS analysis.
- **Unit & integration test suites** across all three services + CI pipeline.
- **Dockerized deployment** with `docker-compose` for one-command startup.
- **Configurable scoring weights** and an extensible skills dictionary via the UI.
